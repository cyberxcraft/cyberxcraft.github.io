<center><font color="white"><h1>Here is some discription of art</h1></center>
<center><p>Art is a diverse range or product of human activity that involves creative or imaginative talent<br> expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.<br>

There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and ideas have changed over time.<br> The three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.<br>Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and<br> other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the <br>arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated<br> from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century<br>, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts<br> are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the <br>decorative or applied arts.

The nature of art and related concepts, such <br>as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch z<br>of philosophy known as aesthetics.The resulting artworks are studied <br>in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.</p></center>
<center><h1>Different types of art</h1></center>
<center><p>There are countless forms of art. When it comes to visual arts, there are generally 3 types: decorative, commercial, and fine art.<br>

The broader definition of “the arts” covers everything from painting through theatre, music, architecture,<br> and more. However, the visual arts are those artistic creations that we can see, like sculptures or paintings.
<center><h1>Why is art important?</h1></center>
<center><p>Art makes people optimistic about their future. Art can be used to help spread a message of inspiration,<br> making people achieve great things in life. Art can be a form of communication <br> between people, to focus on common issues for the betterment of humankind.<br> Inspirational music is the best form of creative art.</p></center>
<center><h1>Who invented art?</h1></center>
<center><p> There is not a specification of the person who created art. either way he or she who created art lived approximately<br> 70,000 years ago!!!.that is the age of the oldest artwork in the world, a piece<br> of soft red stone that somone scratched lines on in a place called blomos cave</p></center>
