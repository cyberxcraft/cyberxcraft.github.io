			<center><p>This is a  website for those seeking inspiration, or advice. I finally<br> decided to own that role and be intentional about it<br>. I started writing about my passions, my thoughts, and<br> curious wonderings about our world. I founded CYB3R<br> X CRAFTS with a mission to give others a taste of<br> what goes on in my mind, and I have been at it ever <br>since -Abdul Mohaiymin.</center><p>
